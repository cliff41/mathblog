     This is a mistake I frequently make and my teacher never truly explained this. I kept on getting questions wrong and wondered, "What on Earth did I do wrong?"
     <br>
     <br>
     As an example, let's take this question from Cambridge Maths NSW Year 9 5.3 Second Edition. This is Chapter 8D, question 7g.
     <br>

        <i>
        Factorise the following:
    <br>
        g) 49-(𝑥+3)<sup>2</sup>
        </i>
     <br>
     <br>
     First, as the example in the textbook suggests, turn the 49 into a square, so we can make the equation a difference of squares.
     <br>
     = <i>7<sup>2</sup>-(𝑥+3)<sup>2</sup></i>
     <br>
     <br>
     We all know that the expansion of the difference of squares is <i>(𝑎+𝑏)(𝑎-𝑏)</i>, with in this case 𝑎 being 7<sup>2</sup> and 𝑏 being -(𝑥+3)<sup>2</sup>. This is the next step, however here I made a mistake.
     <br>
     <br>
     I got the answer <i>(7+𝑥+3)(7-𝑥+3)</i>. I thought this was right. One of 𝑥+3's was subtracting from 7, the other one adding. "That follows the rules, right?" is what I thought in my head.
     <br>
     I added the 7 and 3 in both brackets, with a final answer of:
     <i>(10+x)(10-x)</i>. After I finish the entirety of the excersise, I flip back to the answers. Low and behold, I got 7g wrong.
     <br>
     <br>
     The answer was… (10 + x)(4 – x)? I thought this wrong. I chucked it into Microsoft Math Solver. Same answer (although it had used a different method from me and the textbook). 
     I hopped on the online version of the textbook, with its step-by-step answers. I was stunned.
     <br>
     <br>
     Remember that step where I got <i>(7+𝑥+3)(7-𝑥+3)</i>? Well, it turns out they got <i>(7+𝑥+3)(7-𝑥-3)</i>. "How???" I shouted. I almost woke up all my neighbours with my 3am math shenanigans.
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Now, time for the math explanation. If you skipped to this part, duck you.
     <br>
     <br>
     I got the first set of brackets correct, which required adding. However, it was the subtracting I got wrong. <i>7-(𝑥+3)</i>. I got that simple of an equation wrong? Dumbfounded, I consulted Bing AI. It used a different method to solve the equation, meaning it took me some time to fully understand its response.
     <br>
     <br>
     The AI said to me that you have to change the signs of the 𝑥 and the 3, which means changing them from positive to negative. The reason why is because when you subtract 𝑥+3, what you are really doing is subtracting each of the terms individually from 7. If that's a little complicated, then just imagine that the positive 𝑥 and positive 3 turned into negatives because the minus sign beside the brackets was being multiplied with each term.
     <br>
     <br>
     So remember: If you've got to subtract a positive binomial from something, remember to turn all the terms in the binomial negative.
